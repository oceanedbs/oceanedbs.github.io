Hackathon TOM France 2024: Innovative Solutions for Accessibility

---

On July 8-9, 2024, as a member of ISIR, I participated in the third edition of the TOM France Hackathon. Collaborating within 16 project teams, we leveraged our knowledge to tackle challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. The teams aimed to design technological solutions addressing specific daily needs, working closely with project initiators to ensure practical, impactful outcomes.

I took part in developing a solution to aid Etienne, a wheelchair user, in safely and comfortably transferring between his wheelchair and a bed or sofa. We devised an innovative dual-solution system. For wheelchair-to-bed transfers, we created a lever-actuated plate mechanism that elevates the seat cushion to align with the wheelchair's wheels, removing obstacles. For bed-to-wheelchair transfers, we proposed an adjustable system using electric actuators and commercially available sliders to elevate standard beds or sofas on demand. This approach offers a cost-effective and adaptable alternative to traditional medical beds.

The TOM (Tikkun Olam Makers) Hackathon is an international initiative uniting engineers, designers, makers, and end users to create practical, innovative technologies that enhance the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. This year's edition brought together participants from diverse backgrounds for an intense two-day collaboration, demonstrating the power of technology to transform daily life.
