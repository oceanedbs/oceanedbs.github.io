The theme : " Human-Animal Cohabitation " 👩‍🦲🐶🐭🐼🐻🐷🐸🐵


<p>How do we think about the coexistence of humans and animals today? Sometimes passionate, sometimes disinterested, sometimes tumultuous, this question is today at the heart of a societal debate with ethical, economic, political, social, environmental and health issues at stake 🌱👩‍🔬👨‍💼
Today, man has appropriated most of the land and invaded the landscape. He breeds animals en masse to feed himself, make his clothes, his objects. Animals that are nevertheless sensitive, intelligent and suffering 🐯🐥🐺🦉🐴🐓🐇🐁 Nearly 65 billion animals are killed for their meat every year worldwide, according to the FAO. In addition, deforestation and air and ocean pollution contribute to the dramatic decline in biodiversity 🌏🌊Parallel to this, domestic animals are highly prized with 63 million pets in France, almost as many as the French population 🐕🐈
What is and should be the place of animals today? What are the limits of this model? What changes need to be made? </p>
