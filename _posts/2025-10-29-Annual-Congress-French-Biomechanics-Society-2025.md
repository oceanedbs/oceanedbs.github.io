I had the opportunity to present two research studies at the French Society of Biomechanics conference in Marseille, 2025:

- Persistent Changes in Upper-Limb Coordination Following Repetitive Exoskeleton Use  
  O. Dubois, G. Brunelli, A. Roby-Brami, R. Parry, N. Jarrassé

- Assessing Inter-Joint Coordination in CrossFit: A Pilot Study Comparing Advanced and Beginner Practitioners  
O. Dubois, A. Roby-Brami, R. Parry, N. Jarrassé

It was a fantastic experience sharing our findings, discussing motor coordination and biomechanics, and connecting with fellow researchers and practitioners in the field.
