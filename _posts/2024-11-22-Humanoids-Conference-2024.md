I presented, at the Humanoids 2024 conference, my poster about my work entitled : Identifying Individual Characteristics Influencing Post-Adaptation of Motor Behavior in Upper-Limb Exoskeleton Users. This work was done thanks to Agnès Roby-Brami, Ross Pary and Nathanaël Jarrassé.

The paper liked to this presentation can be found in my publications.
