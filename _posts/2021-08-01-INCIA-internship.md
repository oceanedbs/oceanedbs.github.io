Control of a Robotic Upper Limb Prosthesis at the Institute of Cognitive and Integrative Neuroscience of Aquitaine (INCIA), University of Bordeaux, within the Hybrid Sensorimotor Control Team

Supervision: Aymar de Rugy

This project aimed to transfer a prosthesis control system developed in virtual reality to a robotic arm (Reachy - Pollen Robotics). Virtual reality was implemented using a Vive Pro headset (HTC Corporation) and Vive Trackers to capture motion data, which was then transmitted to the robotic arm. Two control modes were developed: the first mode involved teleoperation, replicating the angular positions of the user's joints; the second mode utilized contextual and kinematic information to predict the robotic arm's joint positions through a neural network.
