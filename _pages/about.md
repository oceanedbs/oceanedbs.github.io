I am a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Jožef Stefan Institute, in the Department of Automatic, Biocybernetic, and Robotic Systems, within the [Laboratory for neuromechanics and biorobotics](https://nbr.ijs.si/) (NBR), under the supervision of Jan Babič. My research focuses on understanding human motor strategies and adaptation during collaboration with robotic systems. By studying how humans interact with robots, I aim to develop more reliable and adaptive controllers for robotic devices.

I also practice photography and running.
