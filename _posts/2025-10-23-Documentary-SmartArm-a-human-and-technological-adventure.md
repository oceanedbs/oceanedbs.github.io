I’m thrilled to share that I directed a documentary following the incredible journey of the Smart ArM team at ISIR, who designed an innovative prosthetic arm to enable their pilot, Christophe Huchet, to compete in the Cybathlon.
Over five years, I've captured the team’s challenges, trials, and small victories, showing how science and technology can serve human ambition. 

The final version of the documentary is a total of 8 episodes of around 20minutes each. A condensed version of 1h30 in total will soon be made available.
