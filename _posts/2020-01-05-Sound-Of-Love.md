Video project produced as part of the UTC interactive and multimedia writing program supervised by Serge Bouchardon

Interactive narratives, video games, digital art... To what extent can the characteristics of digital and multimedia media generate new forms of writing?

This project is a video story that evolves differently according to the user's choices. At different times, users can choose between 2 different sounds. Depending on their choice, the story will evolve differently.

You can view the project [here](/assets/Sound_Of_Love/index.html). It's better to use Chrome and to listen with a headset.
