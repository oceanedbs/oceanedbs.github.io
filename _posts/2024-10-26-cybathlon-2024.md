  <li>In the ARM category, 10 tasks were presented to the pilots:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Carry Bottles</strong><br>Place weighted bottles into the crate and carry them to the table. Test involves picking up and carrying heavy objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Serving Food</strong><br>Carry a casserole dish and a frying pan from the stove to a location on a table. Test involves grasping and carrying objects of significant weight from one location to another.</li>
  <li><strong>Storing Dishes</strong><br>Grasp and stow away kitchen objects at the predefined target locations. Test involves manipulating objects in confined spaces and at varying heights.</li>
  <li><strong>Hanging Laundry</strong><br>Hang up the hooded sweater on the clothesline using a hanger. Test involves compatibility of the prosthesis's function, size, and shape for daily life tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Do-It-Yourself</strong><br>Use a variety of hand tools in the context of do-it-yourself type work. Test involves dexterous use of hand tools with the prosthetic hand and wrist.</li>
  <li><strong>Containers</strong><br>Conduct a series of kitchen-related bimanual tasks. Test involves using kitchen tools and objects with precise two-handed actions.</li>
  <li><strong>Haptic Bag</strong><br>Identify and fetch objects of various shapes and flexibility without visual assistance. Test involves feeling different shapes and compliance of objects with prostheses.</li>
  <li><strong>Hot Wire</strong><br>Guide a loop with the prosthetic hand along a curved metal wire without touching it. Test involves maintaining a tight grip during sustained postural changes of the prosthetic hand.</li>
  <li><strong>Stacking</strong><br>Stack cups into a vertical pyramid. Test involves maintaining a stable grip during postural changes of the arm.</li>
  <li><strong>Clean Sweep</strong><br>Move objects from the box on one table to the target position on the other table. Test involves picking up small objects of varying shapes, sizes, and textures.</li>
</ol>
