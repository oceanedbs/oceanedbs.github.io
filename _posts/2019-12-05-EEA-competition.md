Since 2016, the EEA Club has organized a national competition called "My Project in 5 Minutes" to promote project-based learning in the fields of Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Automation, and Industrial Engineering (EEA).

This educational approach combines technical skills and interpersonal abilities, often involving teamwork over varying timeframes. Through supervised projects, students can:

    Apply the knowledge acquired during their studies.
    Work as part of a team under constraints of time, performance, and resources.
    Showcase initiative, autonomy, and responsibility.
    Address real-world needs by analyzing requirements and proposing suitable solutions.
    Develop communication skills.

We participated with the Hermes Project, which goal was to teleoperate an autonomous vehicule for some specific situations where the help of a human, to take the decision, was needed.
