Participation to the Art and Science summer school : Useful fictions. Creation of zoïmorphism.

---
During the Useful Fiction Summer School 2024, exploring links between art and science, I took part of the Zoïmorphism Lab. This lab delves into the boundaries between the artificial and the living through biomimetic sculptures in motion. Over the course of a week, artists and scientists collaborated to design flexible chimeras inspired by vegetal and animal forms, brought to life by magnetic forces and controlled through interactive technologies such as sensors, and microcontrollers. These "zoimorphs" will evolve within aquariums, fostering an immersive dialogue between human and non-human entities. At the intersection of art and science, the project invites participants to question the interactions between the contemporary body and its environment in an open, collaborative spirit. The creations have been exposed during an interactive exhibition weekend at the Centre Wallonie-Bruxelles in Paris.

Facilitators: Antoine Desjardins and Giancarlo Rizza, assisted by Eléonore Aidonis and Pierre Bourdon

Participants: Océane Dubois, Juan-Pablo Guzman-Alvarez, Morgane Porcheron, Dziyana Tarasenka, Tassadit Zouaoui
