I’m thrilled to share that I directed a documentary following the incredible journey of the Smart ArM team at ISIR, who designed an innovative prosthetic arm to enable their pilot, Christophe Huchet, to compete in the Cybathlon.
Over five years, I've captured the team’s challenges, trials, and small victories, showing how science and technology can serve human ambition. 

The documentary comprises 8 episodes of approximately 20 minutes each. A condensed 1h30 version will be available soon. Watch the full series on YouTube: [SmartArm — full series playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34Uq3v7cZ37iT3kpwSWvD6e__6aT4wvq&si=7e_Bo96s0oJTbcox).
