I‚Äôm excited to share that along with my colleague In√®s Lac√¥te, am featured in the Science XX elles initiative! We are both postdoctoral researchers at the ISIR ‚Äì Institute for Intelligent Systems and Robotics.

What do we have in common?
We study human‚Äìmachine interactions, in different fields but with the same goal: to make our research meaningful and beneficial to society.

Together, hand in hand, we explore robotics with one mission: to make technology serve society. ü§ùü¶æ
