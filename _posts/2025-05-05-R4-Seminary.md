I had the honor of being invited to present my research on the lasting impact of exoskeletons on human coordination during a recent seminar organized by R4, the regional robotics network of Nouvelle-Aquitaine.

R4 brings together 12 research institutions in the region with the goal of fostering collaboration and advancing robotics research through regular scientific exchanges, including a weekly working group.

It was a valuable opportunity to share insights and engage in discussions with fellow researchers in the field.

Here is a recording video of the presentation :
