At the ISIR photo contest 2025, two of my analogue photographs received awards. The jury, consisting of 10 ISIR lab members, selected one image, while the public—comprising all lab members—chose the other.

The first photo, recognized by the jury, captures a training session with the Smart Arm team. The public award went to a composite image combining two scenes: one of the lab buildings and another, mirrored, depicting storage for electronic components.
